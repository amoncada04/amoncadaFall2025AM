<p>"The clavarioid fungi are a group of fungi in the Basidiomycota typically having erect, simple or branched basidiocarps (fruit bodies) that are formed on the ground, on decaying vegetation, or on dead wood. They are colloquially called club fungi and coral fungi.

Originally such fungi were referred to the genus Clavaria ("clavarioid" means Clavaria-like), but it is now known that clavarioid species are not all closely related. Since they are often studied as a group, it is convenient to retain the informal (non-taxonomic) name of "clavarioid fungi" and this term is frequently used in research papers." (Source: Wikipedia) </p>
<p>"The largest current genus is Ramaria, which has species with branched fruit bodies and ochre to brownish spores. Clavariadelphus, producing large, club-shaped fruit bodies, is closely related.[5] Clavaria in its modern sense is restricted to white-spored species, many simple, some branched. It is not clearly distinguished from two related genera, Clavulinopsis and Ramariopsis.[4] The genus Typhula contains a number of small, sometimes minute species with simple fruit bodies. Smaller genera of clavarioid fungi include Alloclavaria, Aphelaria, Artomyces, Chaetotyphula, Clavariachaete, Clavicorona, Clavulina, Ertzia, Lachnocladium, Lentaria, Lepidostroma, Multiclavula, Pterula, Scytinopogon, and Sulzbacheromyces."(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
"The spores of Ramaria species are yellow-brown to rusty-brown in mass deposit and range from smooth to warted to echinulate or striate. Spore size may vary considerably, and ornamentation, when present, is cyanophilous." (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
</p>

<p>"The genus Ramaria comprises approximately 200 species of coral fungi.[1] Several, such as Ramaria flava, are edible and picked in Europe, though they are easily confused with several mildly poisonous species capable of causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea; these include R. formosa and R. pallida. Three Ramaria species have been demonstrated to contain a very unusual organoarsenic compound homoarsenocholine."[2] (Source: Wikipedia)

    		<p>"Currently, Ramaria is placed in the Gomphaceae,[7] although some older sources still classify it in the Ramariaceae. Ramaria has been further subdivided into four subgenera based on differences in spore ornamentation, substrate habitat, clamps, and basidiocarp appearance.[5]" (Source: Wikipedia)</p>
