			<h2>About</h2>
			<p>"Aureoboletus mirabilis, commonly known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet top, is a species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has a dark reddish-brown cap, yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap, and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations."(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
			<p>"Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A. mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of Hemlock trees, suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite the occasional appearances to the contrary, A. mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms a close association with the tree's roots. The mushroom is edible."</p>
			<p>"The proper disposition of this species in the present taxonomic scheme of the boletes is somewhat debatable. ... The distinction between Boletus and Boletellus is not so clear-cut. The spores are typically smooth which, in conjunction with the divergent tube trama, dry to moist pileus and yellow tubes, seem to place it very convincingly in Boletus. However, the present disposition in Boletellus seems most satisfactory to me. The sporocarps have the stature and general appearance of other members of that genus such as Boletellus russellii and B. ananas (Curt.) Murr. These similarities include the disproportionately long stipe which is frequently shaggy-reticulate and constricted at the apex, and a comparatively small pileus.[6]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
			<p>"The species has also been placed in genus Heimioporus, newly described in 2004 by Swiss mycologist Egon Horak.[1][8] In 2015 it was transferred to the genus Aureoboletus based on DNA evidence.[9]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
			<p>"The specific epithet mirabilis means "admirable" or "marvelous".[11] Aureoboletus mirabilis is commonly known as the "admirable bolete",[12] the "bragger's bolete",[13] and the "velvet top".[14]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
			<h3>Characteristics</h3>
			<p>"Collected in deposit, the spores are olive-brown.[2] Viewed with a microscope, the spores are spindle-shaped to roughly elliptical, with smooth, thick walls, and have dimensions of 18–22 by 7–9 μm. Overholts' 1940 publication on the species reported spore dimensions of 20–26 by 8–9 μm.[20] The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), 4-spored, and 31–36 by 7–11 μm. Cystidia (sterile cells on the face of a gill) are thin-walled, and measure 60–90 by 10–18 μm.[7] There are no clamp connections present in the hyphae.[16]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
			<h3>Habitat</h3>
			<p>"The fruit bodies grow solitarily, scattered, or sometimes in small groups on the ground or on well-decayed conifer logs, especially of western and mountain hemlock, but occasionally also Douglas-fir and western red cedar.[22] The fungus is strongly suspected to form mycorrhizal associations with hemlock, although standard attempts at growing B. mirabilis mycorrhizae in laboratory culture have failed.[23] Although fruit bodies are sometimes found growing on logs with advanced brown cubical rot—a trait suggestive of cellulose-decomposing saprobic fungi—the rotten wood harboring the fungi typically contains abundant conifer roots. It has been suggested that B. mirabilis has specifically adapted to this niche to reduce competition for nutrients with other mycorrhizal fungi, and further, that the inability to culture mycorrhizae in the lab using standard techniques may be because certain physical or chemical characteristics of the wood with brown cubical rot are required for fungal growth.[23]
                Aureoboletus mirabilis, which usually appears from late summer to autumn, is distributed in the hemlock forests of the Pacific Coast Ranges from Northern California to Alaska, the Cascade Range, as well as in interior forests such as in Manitoba.[7][20][24] It has a disjunct distribution, as it has been also been collected in Japan and Taiwan.[25][26]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
            <h4>Common Uses</h4>
			<p>"Aureoboletus mirabilis is edible, yet tasteless according to Murrill, who also noted that "this is one of the most difficult species to preserve, owing to its extremely juicy consistency".[2] In contrast, modern field guides suggest this species to be an excellent edible.[7][13] One book opines that only Boletus edulis surpasses its flavour.[27] When sauteed in butter, the flesh has been noted to have a lemony taste.[22]

Field specimens covered with the white mold Sepedonium ampullosporum should not be consumed.[11] The mushroom may also be attacked by Hypomyces chrysospermus.[17](Source: Wikipedia)
