                    <h3>Mushroom Description</h3>
                    <p>"Hypomyces lactifluorum, or the lobster mushroom, is a parasitic ascomycete fungus that grows on certain species of mushrooms, turning them a reddish orange color that resembles the outer shell of a cooked lobster. The fungus is edible."(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
                    <p>"Contrary to its common name, the species itself is neither a lobster nor a mushroom.

H. lactifluorum specifically attacks members of the genera Lactarius and Lactifluus (milk-caps), as well as Russula (brittlegills), such as Russula brevipes and Lactifluus piperatus in North America. At maturity, the reddish orange H. lactifluorum thoroughly covers its host, rendering it unidentifiable.[1][2] As it ages, its color can go from the entire sporocarp surface and lamella to the margin of the mushroom.[3]

The species produces a white spore print.[2]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
<p>"Similar species include Hypomyces cervinigenus, H. chrysospermus, and H. luteovirens.[1] Turbinellus floccosus has a similarly colored cap, but its underside has fine wrinkles rather than wavy gills.[2] White, pink, and yellow molds could be toxic lookalike species.[4]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>

                    <h3>Where To find It</h3>
                    <p>"Hypomyces lactifluorum is found in wooded areas, often near Russula brevipes or Lactarius growing in conifer forests, in particular under ponderosa pine in the American Southwest and the Pacific Northwest.[5] Its range in the woods has been described as "solitary, scattered or gregarious" depending on location.[6]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>

                    <h3>Common Uses</h3>
                    <p>"Lobster mushrooms are widely eaten and enjoyed freshly foraged and cooked.[7] They are commercially marketed and sometimes found in grocery stores; they have been made available at markets in Oregon.[7] They have a seafood-like flavor and a firm, dense texture.[citation needed]

While edible, field guides note the hypothetical possibility that H. lactifluorum could parasitize a toxic host and that individuals should avoid consuming lobster mushrooms with unknown hosts, although no instances of toxicity have been recorded.[7][8][9] During the course of infection, the chemicals get converted into other more flavorful compounds, making lobster mushrooms more edible. Lactarius piperatus has a spicy, hot flavor but that flavor is counteracted by the parasite H. lactifluorum, making it more edible and delicious.[10] One author notes that he has personally never experienced any trouble from consuming them[7] and another notes that there have been no reports of poisoning in hundreds of years of consumption.[9]"(Source: Wikipedia)</p>
